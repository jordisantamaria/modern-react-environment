    - Styled Components
    - Emotion
    - Please add...

### Pure CSS with css modules

##### PROS & CONS

**PROS**

- It's easiest to use.
- CSS Classes names are readable, so It becomes easier to find elements by class names in code.
- CSS rules can conflict, so sometimes It's difficult to include extra css and have to use !important.

**CONS**

- Can't use javascript, so can't have as much customization.
- To organize code, have to create a css file for every component, so project ends with a lot of extra files.

### CSS in Typescript

##### PROS & CONS

**PROS**

- Theme customization becomes easier than pure css, thanks to use javascript as constant variables for colors, breakpoints, etc...
- Becomes easier to create multiple themes for example for toogle between dark and light mode.
- Autogenerated css class names are not readable, so It becomes harder to find elements by class names in code.
- To work with a component, only requires to watch a single file, since It includes javascript and css together.
- Everything becomes a component, so It's easier to read the code.

**CONS**

- It's harder to use, requires to learn the library and UI Frameworks with use js in css also makes components customization harder than pure css.
- Since everything becomes a component, It's harder to change html tag element, for example from `div` to `p`

#### Styled Components

##### Features

- **Automatic critical CSS**: Only load css of commponents rendered in page.
- **No class name bugs**: Unique class names for your styles, no duplication.
- **Easier deletion of CSS**: it can be hard to know whether a class name is used somewhere in your codebase. styled-components makes it obvious, as every bit of styling is tied to a specific component. If the component is unused (which tooling can detect) and gets deleted, all its styles get deleted with it.
- **Simple dynamic styling**: adapting the styling of a component based on its props or a global theme is simple and intuitive without having to manually manage dozens of classes.
- **Painless maintenance**: you never have to hunt across different files to find the styling affecting your component, so maintenance is a piece of cake no matter how big your codebase is.
- **Automatic vendor prefixing**: write your CSS to the current standard and let styled-components handle the rest.

##### PROS & CONS

**PROS**

**CONS**

- Se tiene que crear un nuevo componente cada vez que se quiere cambiar algun estilo del componente o incluirlo en style inline.
